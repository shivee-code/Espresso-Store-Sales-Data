<b>FINDINGS:</b>
1. Format the 'amount' column to display values as currency up to 2 decimal places
and apply date formatting to the 'date' column to show dates in 'dd m, yy' format
2. Arrange orders sorted by 'ship city' in Z to A order, and by 'amount' in descending
order. Display orders with an amount greater than 500 and status 'Returned'
3. Retrieve the 'ship state' for a given customer id=442660
4. Label orders as “most demanded” that were placed on Myntra channel and have
amount greater than 800 and rest orders as “least demanded”
5. Count the number of orders from men in the '30-40' age group and extract the
middle part of each order id
6. Replace all occurrences of kurta category to kurta sets and top category to tops
7. Calculate the order dates three months after the given dates
8. Create a One-Way Data Table to show how different interest rates from different
banks affect the loan amount of individuals? (Use What if Dataset)
9. Use Goal Seek to find out how much change in administration expenses would be
required to get the goal profit of 400000? (Use What if Dataset)
10. Create a Pivot Table to summarise total sales (amount) by month. And generate a
Pivot table and chart to compare the number of orders across different age groups.
